      <h1>Visualizing the environmental and social impacts of tyred vehicles</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Tires are regularly undergoing abrasive friction with roads, leading to constant air and noise pollution. Furthermore, at the end of their short lifecycle, they are disposed of, generating mountains of waste each day. However, the general public is mostly unaware of this impact. This has major consequences, however there are also various methods to mitigate these negative effects. This report covers different ways to understand the problems that tires have, as well as strategies have gone into mitigating it.
        <br><br><br>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Part 1: Pollution</h2>
                    

      <p>
        Humans as a species, throw out an estimated 1 billion tires in a year according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Managing End-of-Life Tires<sup>1</sup>. This number is difficult to comprehend and not useful for understanding the scope of the problem. However, for the sake of understanding this rate can be interpolated to obtain the much easier to grasp statistic, of approximately 32 tires per second. The resulting visualization was created using a particle-based physics simulation using a replicated 3D model of a tire. 96 tires were generated over 3 seconds, showing what 32 tires per second would visually look like.
      </p>

      <p><i>Figure 1: Physical visualization of the interpolated rate of tire disposal worldwide</i></p>
      </center>
      <br>
      <p>
          Luckily, there are companies and agencies working on recycling end of life tires (ELTs)<sup>2</sup>. In Australia, government and industry have collaborated to make great strides in recycling ELTs. This is why the rate of recycling has drastically increased since 2017. Data for this visualization was obtained from the 2022 National Waste Database<sup>3</sup>. This data had to first be processed. Data concerning tire waste was isolated from the rest of the database. Then this data was cleaned by removing commas and converting numerical data into usable values.
          
        <br><br><br>
        <div id="chloropleth"></div>
        <center><i>Figure 2: Chloropleth map of the amount of tire waste in tonnes being recycled in each Australian state over time.</i></center>
        <br><br><br>
        <p> This data had spatial and temporal characteristics, and therefore I combined this data with shape and location information using a digital boundary file of the Australian states and territories obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics<sup>16</sup> in order to produce the choropleth map. The database contained waste information from 2006, however since the recycling rate did not change appreciably preceding 2016, a subset was selected from 2012 to 2021 to better showcase the changes. In the years preceding 2016 very little recycling is done, however between 2017 and 2018 this amount jumps drastically, especially in Queensland and New South Wales. This is to be expected as these states are also major contributers to tire waste in Australia. This corresponds with a decrease in ELTs going into landfill between 2017 and 2018 as seen below.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <div id="area"></div>
        <center><i>Figure 3: Stacked line graph of the amount of tire waste in tonnes going to landfill in each Australian state over time.</i></center>
        <br><br><br>
        
        The purpose of this figure is to compliment the choropleth map, by showing which states generate the most waste in landfill. This gives the reader a clear picture of where the majority of tire waste is generated as well as what those states have done to mitigate this. By following the width of the bar it can be seen that New South Wales still sends similar amounts of tire waste to landfill like previous years despite a high rate of recycling, meanwhile Western Australia and Queensland have greatly decreased the amount they send to landfill. This drastic decrease that can be seen in Figure 3 is due to a push by federal government policy<sup>2</sup>. This has greatly reduced the environmental impact of end-of-life tires by preventing microplastics entering the environment from landfill. However, recycling only occurs on what’s left of the tire after it’s been used. In a best-case scenario 80% of the tire tread has been removed before the tyres are replaced<sup>4</sup>.
        <br><br>
        So where did all that extra material go? A 2017 study on concentrations of tire wear microplastics conducted in the Netherlands discovered the pathways by which the majority of tire microplastics enter the environment<sup>5</sup>. When driving, due to abrasion with the road, rubber particles are sprayed into the air, mix into the soil, then wash into rivers, lakes and ocean. These microplastics are sprayed into the environment, regardless of whether a car is electric or powered by a internal combustion engine.
      </p>
      <br>    
      <div id="bar"></div>
      <center><i>Figure 4: Bar chart of the tonnes of microplastics entering soil, water, air and sewage systems per annum in the Netherlands.</i></center>
      <br>
      <p>
      As can be seen, the majority of microplastics are absorbed into the soil. However, a small proportion is removed via runoff or released into the atmosphere. This bar chart was constructed using univariate data from a list of values found in the aforementioned 2017 study, determining the approximate quantity of microplastics found in a road environment and in sewage treatment plants per year. Percentage error bars were added using the upper threshold of the error estimate provided by researchers in the study. It should also be noted that this figure is simply communicating how the microplastics enter the environment and not their final location. After a time, a large proportion is theorized to enter the ocean via rain and runoff<sup>5</sup>. The purpose of this figure is to illustrate how tires are a significant source of microplastics in the environment.
      <br><br>
      This raises the question, what do these microplastics consist of? A typical passenger tire is composed of over 30 different types of ingredients<sup>6</sup>. This is difficult to list or display intuitively. Therefore, a sunburst chart was used to convey the proportions of ingredients that go into making a tire. This data was gathered from a meta-analysis on studies into the composition of an average car tyre.
    <br><br><br>
      </p>
    <center>
      <div id="pie"></div>
      <i>Figure 5: Sunburst chart of the different proportions of ingredients in kilograms that compose the average tire.</i>
      <p>(hover for more detail)</p>
    </center>    
    <br><br><br>
    <p>
      This data is univariate and hierarchical as the ingredients fit into a set of broad categories depending on their purpose. The majority of a tire is composed of rubber, with about half being synthetic rubber. The proportion of filler is also visible. Interestingly, a significant amount of antiozonants and antioxidants are added, around 0.61 kilograms. The most commonly used chemical for this purpose, 6PPD, is highly toxic to fish<sup>7</sup>, which makes this formulation concerning.
      <br><br>
      Clicking on this chart lets one focus on the proportions of a specific category of material. Furthermore, the sunburst plot circumvents the typical limitations of a pie chart as hovering over sections outputs the total weight (in kilograms) of that ingredient present in the average tire. This compacts a lot of categorical and numerical data intuitively into a small area, giving both an qualitative and quantitative understanding of tire composition.
    </p>

      <h2>Part 2: Efficiency</h2>
      <p>
        Tires are designed to be large and have high grip. This is called static friction and it’s an absolute necessity because without this, cars would have no traction and cause more accidents than they already do. The static friction of tires makes cars great at starting and stopping, but there’s a downside. When they are in motion they generate a great amount of friction, slowing them down. This is kinetic friction also known as “rolling resistance” and this friction uses up energy that is then wasted as heat and noise. The average combustion engine is about 40% efficient<sup>9</sup>. When driving however, up to half of the energy that makes it to the wheels is consumed by the tires<sup>9</sup>, which means electric cars aren’t immune to this either. This extra energy and by extension CO2 is wasted as heat and noise pollution.
      </p>
    <div id="sankey"></div>
    <center><i>Figure 6: Sankey diagram of different ways energy is lost after reaching the trasmission</i></center>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>This diagram shows the flow of energy once it makes it past the car's transmission which applies for both combustion and electric cars. The data was gathered from the Australian National University, from a model of how energy is spent in a car<sup>9</sup>. This gives a visual representation of how much energy is lost via drag and rolling resistance compared to something more familiar like air resistance and braking. Almost all this energy is then lost has heat, but a small amount also becomes noise pollution.</p>
    <h2>Part 3: Noise</h2>
    <p>
      Most people would assume the engine is the loudest part of a car. In fact, one of the big selling points for electric cars is how quiet they are. However, noise levels are very similar outside of a soundproofed vehicle. The rolling noise of the tires becomes louder than the engine at speeds over 30kmph<sup>8</sup>. So, most of the time it’s the tires that are to blame for why cars are loud. Believe it or not, this used to be a much bigger problem in the past, when tires used to make a high frequency hum. This clip was gathered from a car in the 1920s<sup>10</sup>.
<br><br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/UpsilonAlpha/TireTirade/blob/main/OldNoise.wav?raw=true" type="audio/wav">
</audio>
<br><br>
That’s because this regular pattern of treads causes the tires to make noise at the same frequency which sounds harsh and loud. In order to solve this, the brand-new field of pitch sequence engineering was born. Engineers experimented with different patterns, to take that single loud peak of noise, and distribute it across different frequencies. So modern tires are specifically designed to make white noise <sup>15</sup>. This clip was collected personally using a microphone on Metroad 5 Brisbane.
<br><br>

<br><br>

The volume of these recordings was first normalized, then a fast fourier transform algorithm was used to extract the frequencies from these recordings. Due to the noisiness of the real-world recordings a Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm with a strength of 100 was also applied. This produces a smoother spectrum of the frequencies obtained, by approximating each set of 100 data points with a third degree polynomial, simplifying the plot while still representing the data well. The animation below shows the transition between the sharp harmonic sound produced by the 1920s tire to the smooth "white noise" of a modern tire.
    </p>

    <div id="fourier"></div>
    <center><i>Figure 7: A fourier transform of the sound made by tires manufatured in the 1920s and modern tires</i></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
  As can be seen, both frequency spectrums have a similar shape, however the peaks present in modern tires are greatly accentuated in the tires from the 1920s. The animation shows how these peaks have been reduced, especially at around 500Hz. Unfortunately, this white noise, while less noticeable, can be seriously detrimental to health. It causes sleep disturbances and might be the reason why people in cities are always tired. This has also been shown to increase anxiety, especially in children. Because of these stress-altering effect tire noise has also significantly increased the rate of chronic heart failure, the number 1 killer of humans<sup>10</sup>. So, while modern tires are less "loud", they can still have serious negative health effects.

<h2>A Tireless Future?</h2>
<p>
While it may seem like tyres are here to stay, there are still many other ways to minimize their negative impacts. One alternative is more frequent use of rail transport. Trains also have a very high capacity, further reducing car use<sup>13</sup>. Railway lines don't shed microplastics are they are made using mostly only steel, wood, and concrete. Due to this rail infrastructure can also be more easily recycled compared to tyres. They are also far more efficient in terms of rolling resistance as steel wheels are used instead of tires. On the other hand bikes use tires, but they are smaller and under less mechanical load. Bike infrastructure and riding is also much more energy efficient<sup>14</sup>. Buses are also viable because they use fewer tires to transport far more people<sup>13</sup>. A final benefit is that all these forms of transport have lower rates of fatalities and serious injuries per year (FSI)<sup>12</sup>. These factors can be seen in combination be seen below.
<br><br><br>

</p>
<div id="scatter"></div>
<center><i>Figure 8: A bubble chart of the fatal and significant injuries against grams of CO2 per kilometer with bubble size representing capacity on a 3.5 meter wide corridor</i></center>

<p>
  Data was gathered from three separate studies for this final visualization, to produce a plot of trivariate data for comparison purposes. From one 2019 study, the emissions of CO2 in grams per kilometer for different types of vehicle were obtained<sup>14</sup>. From a 2022 study the FSI per annum for each mode of transport in the Australian state of Victoria was obtained<sup>13</sup>. Then finally, from a 1991 study, the number of people that are transported using a given method through a 3.5 meter wide corridor per hour, also known as the "corridor capacity" was obtained. This study also used an average passenger count to account for empty seats on buses and trains.
  <br><br>
  This figure can therefore be qualitatively split into 4 main quadrants. Cars have the highest emissions per kilometre and the highest number of FSIs per year compared to other forms of transport, putting them in the top right quadrant: high emissions and high FSI. Pedestrians and cyclists both all fall under low emission and low FSI (bottom left). Buses have high emissions per kilometre and a low rate of FSI. No form of transport has low emissions and high FSI. Trains have higher emissions than pedestrians and cyclists but lower FSI putting them in between the top and bottom left quadrant.

  This figure also shows that, cars have one of the smallest capacities in a 3.5-meter-wide corridor. Pedestrians, cyclists, and trains have a relatively high corridor capacity as more individuals can travel through the same space. Buses have a similar corridor capacity to cars; however, an important caveat is that this figure does not take into account bi-articulated buses and separated busways which greatly increases corridor capacity<sup>13</sup>. Furthermore, a major reason that FSI for pedestrians and cyclists is higher than trains or buses is due to collisions with cars<sup>12</sup>.
  <br><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

A logical conclusion to draw from this data is that individuals should drive less, take public transport, walk or bike to work. However for many people that might not be an option, due to a lack of infrastructure or frequent service by public transport. This is why more involvement is required in advocating for better transport. Other options include bringing down the price of housing which reduces commute distances and increases the benefits of using alternative forms of transport. There should also be advocacy for recycling and awareness of the environmental impact of tires. What these figures shows is while we many not be able to eliminate tires completely, we can do a lot better using the technology we already have.
<h2>Self evaluation</h2>
I feel like I captured the issues with tires and tire waste pretty well as I approached the topic from a wide variety of angles rather than using a single dataset.
Early on I made the decision that this project would be displayed as a web page. This is because it is in my opinion, one of the most easily accessible formats, as anyone with a device can open a link. This means my report can be viewed on both laptops and mobile devices. For this I decided to use the pyscript and plotly libraries, however this did come with challenges as formatting and displaying the interactive plots slows down the loading of the website greatly.
<br><br>
In terms of design, I aimed to make all visualisations as readable as possible, ensuring elements and labels were clearly visible. I used a theme throughout, to ensure that my figures had a consistent style. I also added interactive elements to enhance a reader’s understanding of the data that are only possible in a web format. Namely, the use of gifs and sound recordings.
However, I do feel like some figures may be difficult to interpret, especially the stacked line graph, as some states are almost invisible. Furthermore, the stacked line graph also may not be colourblind-friendly unlike my other visualisations due to the close proximity of red and green. Hovering over the plot provides clarification, however ideally, no hovering would be required to interpret the data.
<br><br>
Some further limitations arose with the Fourier transform as I initially tried to animate it over time. However, that was too expensive and crashed my browser. Similarly, I attempted to do a higher resolution chloroplast map showing individual regions within Australian states, however in doing so the figure took 2 whole minutes to render.
<br><br>
I believe that the data I chose was perhaps quite simple and did not require extensive processing. Furthermore, the report itself is quite short and so it may be lacking in its explanation of the figures. However, I believe this assignment warrants a 6 solely due to the quality and intuitiveness of my visualisations.
