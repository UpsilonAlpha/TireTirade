      <h1>Visualizing the environmental and social impacts of tyred vehicles</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Tires are regularly undergoing abrasive friction with roads, leading to constant air and noise pollution. Furthermore at the end of their short lifecycle, they are disposed of, generating mountains of waste each day. However, the general public is mostly unaware of this impact. 
        
        This has major consequences, however there are also various methods to help.
        <br><br><br>

      <h2>Part 1: Pollution</h2>
                    

      <p>
        Humans as a species, throw out an estimated 1 billion tires in a year according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Managing End-of-Life Tires<sup>1</sup>. This number is difficult to comprehend and not useful for understanding the scope of the problem. However when interpolated using simple arithmetic you can obtain the much easier to grasp rate of approximately 32 tires every second. This visualization displays this rate using a physics simulation of 32 tires over a period of 3 seconds as a gif to convey the physical size and scope of the tire waste issue.

      <br>
      <p>
          Luckily, there are lots of companies working on recycling end of life tires (ELTs)<sup>2</sup>. In Australia, government and industry have collaborated to make great strides in recycling ELTs. This is why the rate of recycling has drastically increased since 2017 as can be seen in data from the national waste database in 2022<sup>3</sup>.
          
        <br><br><br>
        <div id="chloropleth"></div>
        <center><i>Figure 2: Chloropleth map of the amount of tires going into landfill in each Australian state over time.</i></center>
        <br><br><br>
        
        As can be seen, there is a drastic decrease in the amount of ELTs going into landfill between 2017 and 2018 due to a push by federal government policy<sup>2</sup>. This has greaty reduced the environmental impact of end of life tires by preventing microplastics entering the environment.
          
        However, recycling only occurs on what’s left of the tire after it’s been used. In a best case scenario 80% of the tire tread has been removed before the tyres are replaced<sup>4</sup>. So where did all that extra material go? A 2022 study on concentrations of tire wear microplastics and other traffic-derived non-exhaust particles in the road environment discovered the pathways by which the majority of tire microplastics enter the environment.
          
        When driving, due to abrasion with the road, rubber particles are sprayed into the air, mix into the soil, then wash into rivers, lakes and into the ocean<sup>5</sup>. These microplastics are sprayed into the environment, regardless of whether a car is electric or powered by a internal combustion engine.
      </p>
      <br>    
      <div id="bar"></div>
      <center><i>Figure 3: Bar chart of the tonnes of microplastics entering soil, water, air and sewage systems.</i></center>
      <br>
      <p>
      What do these microplastics consist of? A typical passenger tire is composed of over 30 different types of ingredients<sup>6</sup>. This is difficult to list or display intuitively. Therefore a sunburst chart was used to convey the proportions of ingredients that go into making a tire.
    <br><br><br>
      </p>
    <center>
      <div id="pie"></div>
      <i>Figure 4: Sunburst chart of the different proportion of ingredients going into the average tire.</i>
      <p>(click for more detail)</p>
    </center>    
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Clicking on this chart lets one focus on the proportions of a specific type of material. Furhtermore, hovering over sections outputs the total weight (in kilograms) of that ingredient present in the average tire. This compacts a lot of categorical data intuitively into a small area.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: Efficiency</h2>
      <p>
        Tires are designed to be large and grippy. This is called static friction and it’s an absolute necessity because without this, cars would have no traction and cause more accidents than they already do.

        The static friction of tires make cars great at starting and stopping, but there’s a downside. When they are in motion they generate a whole lot of friction, slowing them down. This is kinetic friction also known as “rolling resistance” and this friction uses up energy that is then wasted as heat and noise<sup>9</sup>.

        The average engine is about 40% efficient. Pretty terrible already. When driving however, up to a quarter of the energy that makes it to the wheels is used then used up because of tires<sup>9</sup>, which means electric cars aren’t immune to this either. The range listed on brand new electric cars were likely calculated using ultra-low rolling resistance tires in ideal conditions. The electricity wasted by tires could be used to decarbonise other sectors of the economy, but right now all this extra energy and by extension CO2 is wasted as heat and noise pollution.
      </p>
    <div id="sankey"></div>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>This diagram shows the flow of energy once it makes it to the wheels which applies for both combustion and electric cars. This model was made by the Australian National University, as a model fo how energy is spent in a car. This gives a nice visual representation of how much energy is lost via drag and rolling resistance compared to something familiar like braking.</p>
    <h2>Part 3: Noise</h2>
    <p>
Most people would assume the engine is the loudest part of a car. In fact, one of the big selling points for electric cars is how quiet they are but- the noise is the same to everyone else outside of a soundproofed vehicle. The rolling noise of the tires becomes louder than the propulsion noise of the engine at speeds over 55kmph. So, most of the time it’s the tires that are to blame for why cars are loud.

Believe it or not, this used to be a much bigger problem in the past. That’s because this regular pattern of treads causes the tires to make noise at the same frequency and it was unbearably loud. In order to solve this, the brand-new field of pitch sequence engineering was born. Engineers experimented with different patterns, to take that single loud peak of noise, and distribute it across different frequencies. So modern tires are specifically designed to make white noise.

Unfortunately, this second type of noise can be seriously detrimental to health. It causes sleep disturbances so tires might literally be why you’re always tired. It’s also been shown to increase anxiety, especially in children! And because of this it’s significantly increased the rate of chronic heart failure, the number 1 killer of humans.

So, while modern tires are less loud, the total amount of noise is still the same. The same amount of energy is wasted, and the same amount of pollution is sprayed into the environment.
